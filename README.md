# Embedded Systems Buggy Project
Building an autonomous robot in a team of 5 students which followed a white line on a track using reflective sensors and PID controllers by coding in **Arduino** and **C++**.

## My responsibilities
- **Team leader for both hardware and software** in a team of 5 students 
- Implemented the award-winning algorithm (**Track Length Estimation Award**) in **C++** to measure the distance covered by the robot accurately to 3 decimal places (code found in `Source Code/distancecalc.cpp`)
- Implemented the **coding of the motors, the interface of the sensors and multiple other functions such as steering, stop and turn-around** (code found in `Source Code/FinalCode - Group 37.cpp`)
- Designed the **stripboard** of the reflective sensors (stripboard implementation found in `Schematics`)
- Converted the stripboard to a **PCB** (PCB found in `PCB`)
- Created the **CAD models** for the body of the buggy (models found in `Robot_CAD_Models`)
